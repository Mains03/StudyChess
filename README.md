StudyChess is a tool designed to assist players in their study of chess. It differs from other tools with a heavy focus on memorization and analysis of amateur and master games.

## Motivation

Particularly for chess players who exclusively play online, it is not uncommon to hear that despite all the time and effort put into the game, improvement is either slow and inconsistent or not there at all. Common advice includes playing longer games and doing more puzzles however, due to how common it is, having a puzzle rating more than a thousand Elo points higher than playing strength is now a meme.

We do not believe this discrepancy is any fault of the player.

There are many explanations as to why weaker players do not improve however often these are no more useful than pointing out why a specific game was lost. We believe that there is, however, a common explanation as to why players repeatedly make the same mistakes: lack of intuition.

Bobby Fischer said that "tactics flow from a superior position" but players often do not achieve (and are often unable to maintain) this surperior position because they do not know what ideas they should go for or even what sort of moves would be suitable to the position. Players solve puzzles but are rarely able to put this skill to use whilst they are desparately trying to defend a hopeless position.

StudyChess believes there is a solution, to study master games. Through memorizing games, players build intuition for what ideas are available in a position. Though analysing games, players develop the skill of searching for tactical ideas and finding simple but solid moves. Studying openings and solving puzzles is important but without strong foundations in how a game of chess is actually won, it is useless.
